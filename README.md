## **Wireframes and Flowcharts**

### **Wireframes**
I used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 

You can find my wireframes below:

For the homepage I have only created 1 wireframe as the design is quite basic and looks identical on all screen sizes.

#### Mobile Wireframes

### **Flowcharts**

I have decided to make a flowchart for the sign-in / register proccess to completely understand each step of the process.  
I have used [Draw.io](https://draw.io/) to make this flowchart which you can view below:

### **Database Structure**

I have used MongoDB to set up the database for this project with the following collections:

## **Deployment**

### Local Deployment

I have created the Homework Tracker project using Github, from there I used [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) to write my code. 
Then I used commits to git followed by "git push" to my GitHub repository. 
I've deployed this project to Heroku and used "git push heroku master" to make sure my pushes to GitHub were also made to Heroku. 

This project can be ran locally by following the following steps: (
I used Gitpod for development, so the following steps will be specific to Gitpod. 
You will need to adjust them depending on your IDE. You can find more information about installing packages using pip and virtual environments [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

To clone the project: 

1. From the application's repository, click the "code" button and download the zip of the repository.
    Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the following line in your terminal:

    ``` 
    git clone 
    ``` 

1. Access the folder in your terminal window and install the application's [required modules]() using the following command:

    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Sign-in or sign-up to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create a new cluster
    * Within the Sandbox, click the collections button and after click Create Database (Add My Own Data) called dog_health_tracker
    * Set up the following collections: users, dogs, logs, food_metrics and weight [Click here to see the exact Database Structure](#database-structure)
    * Under *** *** and *** ***, add your preferred  in the collection with the following structure: 
        ```
        Key             | Value
        ----------------|-----------
        _id             | ObjectId          This will be automatically generated by MongoDB
        metric_name     | String            Replace string by kg, pounds, grams, ounces etc.
        ```

    * Under the Security Menu on the left, select Database Access.
    * Add a new database user, and keep the credentials secure
    * Within the Network Access option, add IP Address 0.0.0.0

1. In your IDE, create a file containing your environmental variables called env.py at the root level of the application. 
    It will need to contain the following lines and variables:
    ```
    import os

    os.environ["IP"] = "0.0.0.0"
    os.environ["PORT"] = "5000"
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["DEBUG"] = "True"
    os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = "YOUR_MONGODB_URI"
    os.environ["MONGO_DBNAME"]= "DATABASE_NAME" 
    ```

    Please note that you will need to update the **SECRET_KEY** with your own secret key, as well as the **MONGO_URI** and **MONGO_DBNAME** variables with those provided by MongoDB.
    Tip for your SECRET_KEY, you can use a [Password Generator](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) in order to have a secure secret key. 
    I personlly recommend a length of 24 characters and exclude Symbols.
    To find your MONGO_URI, go to your clusters and click on connect. Choose connect your application and copy the link provided. 
    Don't forget to update the necessary fields like password and database name. 

    If you plan on pushing this application to a public repository, ensure that env.py is added to your .gitignore file.

1. The application can now be run locally. In your terminal, type the following command 
    ```
    python3 app.py. 
    ```
    
### To deploy your project on Heroku, use the following steps: 

1. Login to your Heroku account and create a new app. Choose your region. 
1. Ensure the Procfile and requirements.txt files exist are present and up-to-date in your local repository.  
    Requirements:
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    Procfile:
    ```
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```
1. The Procfile should contain the following line:
    ```
    web: python app.py
    ```

1. Scroll down to "deployment method"-section. Choose "Github" for automatic deployment.
1. From the inputs below, make sure your github user is selected, and then enter the name for your repo. Click "search". When it finds the repo, click the "connect" button.
1. Scroll back up and click "settings". Scroll down and click "Reveal config vars". Set up the same variables as in your env.py (IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGODB_NAME):
    !You shouldn't set the DEBUG variable in under config vars, only in your env.py to prevent DEBUG being active on live website. 

    ```
    IP = 0.0.0.0
    PORT = 5000
    SECRET_KEY = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    MONGO_URI = YOUR_MONGODB_URI
    MONGO_DBNAME = DATABASE_NAME
    ```

1. Scroll back up and click "Deploy". Scroll down and click "Enable automatic deployment".
1. Just beneath, click "Deploy branch". Heroku will now start building the app. When the build is complete, click "view app" to open it.
1. In order to commit your changes to the branch, use git push to push your changes.
